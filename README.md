Nearest Driver will be  allocated based on the customer's source location. 
In the first iteration, Drivers available within 2 km radius from the customer's location would be considered. If none available then the next iteration would be 4 km and/or 6 km.
If no drivers are available within 6 km then cancel the request automatically. 
Incase of multiples, higher priority should be given to the rider with the lowest number of trips for that day. Next priority should be given based on  Driverâ€™s ratings. If still you have multiple results, fetch the first record as the Driver to be allocated.
